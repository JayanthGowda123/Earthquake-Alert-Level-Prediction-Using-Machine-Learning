# Earthquake-Alert-Level-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Developed a classification model to predict earthquake alert levels (blue, green, yellow, red). Itâ€™s based on seismic features like magnitude, depth, MMI, CDI, and Significance Score. Implemented and evaluated models including Decision tree and others using accuracy, F1-score and confusion matrix.
